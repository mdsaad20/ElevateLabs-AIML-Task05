A machine learning project that predicts heart disease using decision trees and random forests.

## Features

- ðŸŽ„ Decision Tree classifier with pruning (max_depth=3)
- ðŸŒ³ Random Forest classifier with 100 estimators
- ðŸ“Š Feature importance analysis
- ðŸ“ˆ Model evaluation with cross-validation
- ðŸŒ² Decision tree visualization using matplotlib

## Code Outputs
The script will display:

1. Decision tree visualization

2. Training and test accuracy for both models

3. Feature importance ranking

4. Cross-validation scores
